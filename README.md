# ThreeFive

Running get_threefive.py will print the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three it prints “Three” instead of the number and for the multiples of five 
it prints “Five”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “ThreeFive”.

It is simple technical exercise known also as FizzBuzz written in Python.
